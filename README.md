Interactive Turtles
===================

The intention of this library – interactive turtle graphics – is two-fold:

* to provide a fun toolkit to introduce elementary (Australia/UK: primary) age children to programming from within [Dr Racket](http://racket-lang.org), ideally in the company of a suitably geeky parent or mentor.

* to explore in its implementation some of the simpler ideas of layered languages a la [PLAI](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/).
